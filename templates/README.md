# Templates

The templates within each have a set of default variables that you can define
in the markdown to have them show up in the paper. These include the following (if
a mapping isn't mentioned, assume it's the same as the field name):

 - **authors**: mapped from authors:name
 - **tite** 
 - **repo** 
 - **issue**
 - **vol**
 - **year**
 - **archive_doi**
 - **formatted_doi**
 - **paper_url**
 - **review_issue_url**
 - **submitted**
 - **accepted**
